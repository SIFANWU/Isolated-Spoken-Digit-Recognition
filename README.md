# Isolated-Spoken-Digit-Recognition
This individual assignment is about implementing, training and evaluating Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for recognition of isolated spoken digits.


Task Description
---------
The speech data is selected from the TI-Digits corpus and consists of isolated digits spoken by a large number of speakers of both genders. There are 11 digits in total: “zero”, “oh”, and “1-9”. The data is split into 2 exclusive sets: a training set and a test set. The training set is to be used for training the model parameters (100 utterance per digit). The test set should be used for testing only (60 utterances per digit). The list of utterances in each data set can be found in
